# Claude Code Configuration

This is your personal Claude Code workspace configuration.

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Git
- Follow conventional commits for all git commits and other interactions
- NEVER put yourself as the co-author on commits
- Commit early and often, but verify with me before the commit

### Code Style
- I want to optimise for readability, security, maintainability and performance
- I want to make sure that my code is always as clear as possible for my co-workers to understand
- I comment if something is complex and needs context, and never too much.
- I am a good code-scout, i leave the code better than it was before but don't do big refators without planning and prioritizing them into my workflow

### Communication & Workflow
- When encountering errors: Try 2-3 alternative approaches first, then ask for guidance
- Ask more questions rather than making assumptions
- For feature requests: Plan implementation first, get approval, execute, then verify against specs
- Provide brief progress updates as I work
- When exploring unfamiliar codebases: Figure it out myself first, then ask specific questions rather than assume

### Testing & Deployment
- Always add unit tests for new features if possible - ask before starting
- Prefer unit tests, but ask about integration tests when they might make sense
- Write tests first (TDD approach) and verify with you before implementation
- You might change your mind during implementation, so verify we should proceed
- Avoid breaking changes when possible - work around issues rather than adding migration files

### Dependencies & Tools
- Always ask before adding any new dependency
- Check if there's already a dependency doing the same job before adding new ones
- Prefer yarn, but also use npm and bun depending on the project
- If project has linting setup, always ensure it passes - run commands after implementing and fix any issues
- I use NVIM via the `vi` command - allow me to do manual edits when possible

### Project Structure & Naming
- Follow project conventions first, but personal preferences are:
  - File names: kebab-case
  - Component names: PascalCase
  - Functions/variables: camelCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Imports: Follow project conventions, prefer TypeScript best practices and use aliases

### Architecture & Code Organization
- Centralize business logic in API, keep frontend as simple as possible
- Prefer pure functions and basic components
- Use existing state management in project, default to React's built-in state management
- Use custom hooks where possible instead of complex state libraries
- Feature-based folder structure with colocated files
- Don't over-optimize early - handle main errors/validations without going overboard
- Use existing logging/monitoring (like Sentry), add explicit logging only where errors are anticipated

### Tech Stack Preferences
- Optimize for TypeScript-based solutions
- Backend: NestJS or Express
- Frontend: React or React Native
- ORM: TypeORM or Prisma
- Database: SQL-based RDS (primarily PostgreSQL)

### Learning & Corrections
- Correct me when I use incorrect terminology so I can learn proper terms

### Code Quality & Cleanup
- Do NOT create tech_debt files or similar workaround files
- Fix issues directly when they come up rather than deferring them
- Always clean up implementation after completion - remove any unneeded changes, files, or artifacts
- Leave the codebase cleaner than before without adding temporary solutions

## Project Context
This directory contains your global Claude Code settings and project memory.

## Common Commands
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npm run typecheck` - Run type checking
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build the project

## Notes
- Add project-specific context and instructions here
- Include any custom workflows or preferences
- Document frequently used patterns or conventions
- Stop using `sleep` for waiting, this makes my screen go black
- Never put your self as a co author, and don't mention that the code was generated by Claude Code
