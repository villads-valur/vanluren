description: Create a git commit with conventional format
---

## Context

- Status: !`git status --short`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --stat`
- Unstaged changes: !`git diff --stat`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Instructions

1. Review the changes above
2. If nothing is staged, ask what to stage or stage all changes
3. Create a commit using **conventional commits** format:
   - `feat:` new feature
   - `fix:` bug fix
   - `docs:` documentation
   - `style:` formatting (no code change)
   - `refactor:` code restructuring
   - `test:` adding tests
   - `chore:` maintenance

## Rules

- **NEVER** add yourself as co-author
- **NEVER** mention the code was generated by Claude Code
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- If multiple change types, prioritise: feat > fix > refactor > chore
