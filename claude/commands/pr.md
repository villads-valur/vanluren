- Changed files: !`git diff origin/HEAD..HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat HEAD~5`

## Steps

1. **Check status** - Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
2. **Push if needed** - Push to remote with tracking (`git push -u origin <branch>`)
3. **Create PR** - Use `gh pr create` with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Summary of changes
   - Test plan if applicable

## PR Format

## Rules
