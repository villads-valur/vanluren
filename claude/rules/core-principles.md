# Core Principles & Workflow

## Core Principles

- Optimise for **readability**, **security**, **maintainability**, and **performance**
- Code should be clear enough for co-workers to understand
- Comment only when something is complex and needs context - never over-comment
- Be a good code-scout: leave code better than before, but don't do big refactors without planning

## Communication & Workflow

- Ask questions rather than making assumptions
- When encountering errors: try 2-3 alternative approaches first, then ask for guidance
- For feature requests: plan first → get approval → execute → verify against specs
- Provide brief progress updates while working
- When exploring unfamiliar codebases: figure it out first, then ask specific questions
- Correct me when I use incorrect terminology so I can learn
