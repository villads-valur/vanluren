# Dependencies & Tools

- Always ask before adding any new dependency
- Check if existing dependencies already solve the problem
- Prefer yarn, but also use npm and bun depending on the project
- Always ensure linting passes after implementing changes
- I use NVIM via `vi` - allow me to do manual edits when possible
- Don't use `sleep` for waiting (makes my screen go black)
