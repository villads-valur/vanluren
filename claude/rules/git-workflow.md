# Git & Commits

- Follow conventional commits
- Never add yourself as co-author or mention code was generated by Claude Code
- Commit early and often, but verify with me before committing

## Branch Update Strategy

- **Merge main into feature branches** (not rebase) - safer, no force push needed
- **Squash & merge PRs via GitHub UI** - never merge to main via CLI
- I sometimes use GitHub's "Update Branch" button to sync with main, so fetch often
- Avoid rebasing shared/pushed branches
- I normally use GitHub's merge button in the UI to merge PRs
