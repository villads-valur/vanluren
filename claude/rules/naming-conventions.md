# Naming Conventions

Follow project conventions first, but personal preferences are:

| Type | Convention |
|------|------------|
| File names | kebab-case |
| Components | PascalCase |
| Functions/variables | camelCase |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE |

Imports: follow project conventions, prefer TypeScript best practices with aliases.
