# Ticket Format

When creating issues or tickets in a project management system like Linear, use this format:

## Structure

```markdown
## Goal

[Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished]

## Context

[Design links, references, related tickets]
Designs: [link]
Original reference: [link]

## Acceptance criteria

- [Specific, testable requirement]
- [Specific, testable requirement]
- [Specific, testable requirement]
```

## Guidelines

- **Goal** - Single paragraph explaining the purpose
- **Context** - Links to Figma designs, related tickets, technical background
- **Acceptance criteria** - Bulleted list of specific, verifiable outcomes
  - Focus on what the user can do/see
  - Include UI details (labels, placeholders, actions)
  - Be concrete and testable
