# Testing

- Always ask before adding tests for new features
- Prefer unit tests; ask about integration tests when they might make sense
- TDD approach: write tests first, verify with me before implementation
- Verify we should proceed before implementing (I might change my mind)
- Avoid breaking changes - work around issues rather than adding migrations
