# Git Commit

Create commits using conventional commits format.

## Commit Types

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting (no code change)
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance

## Rules

- **NEVER** add yourself as co-author
- **NEVER** mention code was generated by Claude
- Subject line under 50 characters
- Imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- If multiple types, prioritise: feat > fix > refactor > chore

## Process

1. Check git status and diff
2. If nothing staged, ask what to stage
3. Create commit with appropriate type and message
